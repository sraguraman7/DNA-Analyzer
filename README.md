# DNA-Analyzer

My DNA Analyzer project! This is a program written in C++ that receives a sequence of DNA pairs and organizes the information to allow for easy matching and sequence analysis. 

Note: The files included are ones that have been edited and files that are not included (provided.h) were unedited and therefore unecessary to upload.
